Project 0 Create a set with hastable/linked list
Patrick Thomasma's report

For this project I created a set using a hashtable implementation, I used most of the code
found in sventek's textbook regarding making a map ADT with a hashtable while modifying it
to work with the .h that was given to us. When I ran the project with valgrind I got no 
memory leaks and it looks almost exactly the same as the one produced for us in the projects 
specs. Only diference is that the project specs shows more bytes allocated than mine but
I feel like that is a minor difference not worthy of trying to modify my code in order to keep
it exactly the same. I pass all tests for both of the test files and only help I had received
was from the Class TA timmy tang.
